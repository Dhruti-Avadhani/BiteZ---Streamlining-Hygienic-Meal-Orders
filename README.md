Description:
Welcome to the repository for our Environmental Monitoring System, designed to assess the impact of environmental conditions on food quality in a university café setting. This system utilizes a PicoW microcontroller along with sensors such as the MQ135 for air quality monitoring and the DHT11 for temperature and humidity monitoring. By collecting and analyzing data on environmental parameters, our goal is to enhance food safety and quality control measures within the café environment. The repository includes code for interfacing with the PicoW microcontroller, data collection scripts, visualization tools, and documentation to support further development and research in this area.

Key Features:

Code for interfacing with PicoW microcontroller and sensors
Python scripts for data collection and analysis
Tools for visualizing environmental data
Documentation and resources for project setup and usage
